The Met Éireann API is based on a package originally developed by Met Norway.

The Met Norway API documentation is available at https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/documentation.
The Met Éireann API is based on the Version 1.9 of same package, but with some minor changes. 

The latest version of the weather icons are available at https://api.met.no/weatherapi/weathericon/2.0/documentation, and are named according to the `symbol_code` in the weather forecast.
The previous version of the weather icons are available at https://nrkno.github.io/yr-weather-symbols/, and are named according to the `old_id` in the weather forecast.
