# Weather-Zone

Weather-Zone is a weather forecast application utilising third-party weather forecast data.

## Development and Local Deployment
### Environment
The development environment requires:

| Artifact                                 | Download and installation instructions       |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)           | https://nodejs.org/en/download/              |
| [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)            | Included with Node.js installation           |
| [git](https://git-scm.com/)              | https://git-scm.com/downloads                |
| [Python](https://www.python.org/)        | https://www.python.org/downloads/            |

### Setup
#### Clone Repository
In an appropriate folder, run the following commands:
```shell
> git clone https://github.com/ibuttimer/weather-zone.git
> cd weather-zone
```
Alternatively, most IDEs provide an option to create a project from Version Control.

#### Virtual Environment
It is recommended that a virtual environment be used for development purposes.
There are numerous options available; e.g. [venv](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment), [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) etc. 

Please see [Switching between environments](https://python-poetry.org/docs/managing-environments/#switching-between-environments).

#### Environment Setup
In a terminal window, in the `weather-zone` folder, run the following command to setup required environment artifacts:
```shell
> npm install
```

#### Python Setup
In the `weather-zone` folder, run the following command to install the necessary python packages:
```shell
> poetry install
```

# TODO add STORAGE_PROVIDER environment variables

#### Boolean environment variables
Set environment variables evaluating a boolean value, should be set to any of `true`, `on`, `ok`, `y`, `yes` or `1` to set true, otherwise the variable is evaluated as false.

#### FORECAST_PROVIDERS environment variable
The `locationforecast` application may be configured with multiple providers which utilise the
[Locationforecast](https://api.met.no/weatherapi/locationforecast/2.0/documentation) weather forecast API developed by Met Norway.

The `FORECAST_PROVIDERS` environment variable is a comma-separated list of providers to use, of the form `<provider app name>_<provider id>`.

The convention is to name the provider class in the form `<provider id>Provider` where `<provider id>` is camel-cased, e.g. `met_eireann` becomes `MetEireannProvider`.
And the module name should be `<provider id>.py` e.g. `met_eireann.py`.

E.g. the following configures two providers; `met_eireann` and `met_norway_classic`, which will load the `MetEireannProvider` and `MetNorwayClassicProvider` classes respectively.
````shell
FORECAST_PROVIDERS=locationforecast_met_eireann,locationforecast_met_norway_classic
````

See [Locationforecast](docs/readme.md#locationforecast) for more details on the providers.


#### LOCATIONFORECAST_*&lt;provider id&gt;* environment variables
The configuration for each provider in the [FORECAST_PROVIDERS environment variable](#forecast_providers-environment-variable) 
must be provided by an environment variable of the following format:

- Environment variable name

    LOCATIONFORECAST_*&lt;provider id&gt;*; where `<provider id>` is the id of the provider, e.g. `met_eireann`.
  
- Environment variable value

    A semicolon-seperated list of key-value pairs as outlined in the following table.

| Key       | Description                                                                                                                               |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| name      | Display name of provider                                                                                                                  |
| url       | API url. See [Using unsafe characters in URLs](https://django-environ.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tips.html#using-unsafe-characters-in-urls) |
| latitude  | Latitude query parameter name, e.g. `latitude=lat`                                                                                        |
| longitude | Longitude query parameter name, e.g. `longitude=long`                                                                                     |
| from      | From date/time query parameter name                                                                                                       |
| to        | To date/time query parameter name                                                                                                         |
| tz        | A valid [IANA](https://www.iana.org/time-zones) timezone; e.g. `tz=Europe/Dublin`                                                         |

E.g. the following configure the `met_eireann` provider;
````shell
LOCATIONFORECAST_MET_EIREANN="name=Met Ã‰ireann;url=http://metwdb-openaccess.ichec.ie/metno-wdb2ts/locationforecast;latitude=lat;longitude=long;from=from;to=to;tz=UTC"
````
**Note:** Keys not required by a particular provider should be omitted.

> See [Met Ã‰ireann Timezone anomaly](docs/readme.md#met-Ã©ireann-timezone-anomaly) for more details on the `tz` setting.

#### Environment variables
Set environment variables corresponding to the keys in [Table 1: Configuration settings](#table-1-configuration-settings).

##### Secret Key Generation
A convenient method of generating a secret key is to run the following command and copy its output.

```shell
$ python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe())"
```

#### Email
Procedures differ depending on the email provider used.
for example, in order to configure Gmail as the email provider, the following actions must be performed.

* Login to [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/)
* Goto the Google Account settings and select [Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
* Under `How you sign in to Google` ensure 2-Step Verification is enabled
* Search for `App passwords` and create a new app password
* Copy the generated app password, and store securely


### Before first run
Before running the application for the first time following cloning from the repository and setting up a new database,
the following steps must be performed, from a terminal window, in the `weather-zone` folder.

#### Initialise the database
````shell
$ python manage.py migrate
````
#### Create a superuser
Enter `Username`, `Password` and optionally `Email address`.
````shell
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
````

#### Build Bootstrap
Build the customised version of Bootstrap.
````shell
$ npm run build
````

### Run server
In order to run the development server, run the following command from the `weather-zone` folder:

````shell
$ python manage.py runserver
````

By default, the server runs on port 8000 on the IP address 127.0.0.1.
See [runserver](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.1/ref/django-admin/#runserver) for details on passing an IP address and port number explicitly.
